# Caesar
This program must have the user include a key on the command line before compiling. The key must be an integer for the program to continue. Once the key is entered, the user is prompted to enter a string of plain text. Once entered, the program will then encrypt the plain text using the key and move the letters of the plain text depending on the integer the user input.
